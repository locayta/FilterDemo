FilterDemo for iOS
============================

FilterDemo is a demo for that demonstrates simple usage of the Locayta Search Mobile SDK in a single-view iOS app.

It provides functionality to index some given text, then search for the indexed items, returning the results in a table.

To build this project, you will need to drag the LocaytaSearch.framework into the Project's Frameworks group. If there is already a LocaytaSearch.framework listed here, delete it first. Setting the additional compile flags has already been done.
